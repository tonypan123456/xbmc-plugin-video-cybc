This is an XBMC plugin to stream video-on-demand and audio-on-demand content from the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation (Ραδιοφωνικό Ίδρυμα Κύπρου, PIK) website found at www.cybc.com.cy

To install this plugin, download the release zip file and load it onto your XBMC device. Then go to System -> Add-ons -> Install from zip file. Find the location you placed the zip file and click ok. The plugin should then appear under the Video Add-ons and the Music Add-ons locations. A video by XBMC Cyprus has been made that shows how to install it on XBMC running on windows. Here is the link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ls81dXty8Fk

This is my first release of an XBMC plugin and it is very much work in progress so if you hit any problems please let me know through the Issues tab on the top.

Your comments, suggestions and (maybe) thanks are more than welcome!

Enjoy the content!
